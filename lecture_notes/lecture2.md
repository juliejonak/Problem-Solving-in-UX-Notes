### Assignment

#### Instructions

- [ ] Create a card sort study in OptimalWorkshop for Newsie with at least 20 cards.

- [ ] Get at least 5 participants to complete your card sort. They can be family, friends, or peers. In a professional setting, you will often have to source your own users on short notice. So, it is an important skill to practice.

- [ ] Create a sitemap for your chosen project based on the data you received through your card-sort.

- [ ] Summarize your card sort discoveries for your Product Manager. They want to understand what insights you uncovered through this exercise and how they’ll impact the product’s development. Don’t just say, “I did a card sort. I found this.” Be sure to explain why your insights matter.

#### Submission

 - [ ] Submit a link to your card sort.
 - [ ] Submit a link to the results page of your card sort.
 - [ ] Submit a PNG of your completed sitemap.
 - [ ] Submit a link or PDF of your summary.

## What is Information Architecture

Information architecture (IA) helps your users understand their surroundings and find what they’re looking for in our products. IA is often one of the first parts of our product that we design. In doing so, we focus:

> “on organizing, structuring, and labeling content in an effective and sustainable way [in order to] help users find information and complete tasks.”  
> - Usability.gov


There are opportunities and real costs associated with your IA. As explained in _Information Architecture: For the Web and Beyond_ by Peter Morville, these costs include:

- Finding information (What is the cost of frustrating your customers with a poorly organized web site?)  

- Not finding information (How many customers do you lose because they can’t find the product they want on your web site?)  

- The value of education (What is the value of educating your customers about new products and services related to the ones they’re actively   
seeking on your web site?)

- Construction (What does it cost to design and build a web site? How much does it cost to redo it six months later because it doesn’t support   
find-ability or doesn’t scale?)

- Maintenance (Similarly, what does it cost to insure that good designs don’t crumble over time? Will the people who maintain your site know   
where to put new content and when to remove outdated content?)

- Training (For internal, mission-critical information systems that support call centers, for example, what does it cost to train employees to   
use that system? How much could you save if it wasn’t so complicated to use?)  

- The value of the brand (No matter how beautiful your web site is if customers can’t find what they need, your brand loses value in their eyes.   

- How much did you spend on those brand-building TV commercials?)
