## Brainstorming

What is brainstorming in the context of UX, and why is it important?


Let’s begin our creative journey in unit 2, understanding what brainstorming is and why it’s essential. 

Brainstorming is the act of producing ideas or solving problems. As UX designers, this is immensely important as the bulk of our jobs revolve around ideating to solve problems, testing those ideas to see if our ideas work, and then iterating on a solution.

Brainstorming is something that can be done alone or in a group, and there is a lot of debate around which is more effective. 

Regardless of how you conduct your brainstorming, it’s good to understand why brainstorming is so essential. 

First, new ideas. Brainstorming helps us come up with new ideas for solutions. 

Second, it helps us work through problems. To truly understand how to solve a problem, you must first understand the problem inside out. 

Third and finally, it helps improve creative thinking. 

As a UX designer, you’ll spend a significant amount of time thinking creatively about a variety of things. As with any skill, the more your practice creative problem solving through brainstorming, the better you’ll become. 

For the purposes of this objective, I’d like to talk about how you can think about and ultimately conduct brainstorming on your own.

Here is an outline of the key rules of brainstorming:

<br>

### Time limiting

Brainstorming, or idea generation should happen in space where you’re free to think up and generate wild ideas. This can be intimidating and one of the ways to overcome this to set a time limit. When a time limit is set, it’s your goal to come up with as many ideas as possible within that time limit. 

For example, if your goal is to come up with a new home page design, give yourself a maximum of 15 minutes to come up with 10 radical ideas. Your goal is to keep the time limit short and focus on hitting the minimum number of ideas.

<br>

### Understand the problem

This may seem obvious, but you always want to begin your brainstorming sessions with a problem statement. This will ensure that your outcomes are focused on a specific goal. Brainstorming sessions should be focused on only one goal at a time. Staying on topic is of the utmost importance. 

Remember, you can have as many brainstorming sessions as you like, but keep each one focused on only one issue.

<br>

### Defer judgement and self-censoring

Judging ideas during a brainstorming session can not only ruin the mood but keep other people from participating. If you’re brainstorming alone, self-censoring can pose a similar problem. 

Self-censoring occurs when you stop yourself from writing down or acting on an idea in a brainstorming session for fear of it not being good enough. 

Remember, brainstorming is all about generating unique ideas. Often, these ideas may not be the answer, but can get your and your team closer to the answer by looking at the problem through a different lens. You want to allow yourself, and your participants, to feel comfortable generating unusual ideas.

<br>

### Quantity of quality

While brainstorming, you want to generate as many ideas as possible. The more ideas that you create, the more mental connections you will make, and the more likely you are to come up with a reliable solution. Remember ‘quantity breeds quality.’

<br>

### Build on other ideas

As fun as it is to generate wild ideas, it’s important to remember that not all opinions need to stand alone. If you or another team member already created a unique concept, you can use that idea as an opportunity to build from. 

Part of the reason that brainstorming works so well is that novel ideas can often trigger different ways of thinking. Embrace the associated nature of brainstorming and take advantage of everything at your disposal. This will not only help to continue the flow of ideas but will also stop you from getting trapped by your own ways of thinking.

<br>

### Mind Mapping

Creating a mind map is one method of brainstorming independently. A mind map is a way to organize thoughts organically and structure them in a visual way to help with analysis and recall. 

Mind maps consist of tasks, words, concepts, or other related ideas using a graphical layout. When creating a mind map, you begin with a central idea of topic, and build off of it. There are several different types of software that can aid you in the creation of your mind map.

## Storyboarding

What is storyboarding in the context of UX design?

Storyboarding is a technique that UX designers may utilize to help visualize a sequential story, from beginning to end. 

Storyboarding was popularized by the Walt Disney studio in the 1920s. Walt Disney and company used the storyboard to help understand the basics of a story before building it.

<br>

Storyboards are useful to UX designers because they help us, and others involved in the project, visualize a story before we actually go about building something. 

As we’ve all heard, a picture is worth 1,000 words and storyboards are no exception. 

By visualizing our story before creating it, we’re able to showcase content in a way that simply can’t be done through words. Visualizations also tend to increase engagement. Who doesn’t love a good story?

<br>

In UX design specifically, storyboards are used to showcase a user’s experience within a product. 

It helps us understand how someone can use our product over time. UX design is about approaching design with a human-centered mindset. Stories illustrate this concept perfectly. 

Through the creation of a storyboard, we’re thinking about the user before anything else. Storyboards also lend themselves well to an iterative approach. 

Creating a storyboard helps us clearly articulate, and often see the faults in, the stories that we create about our users and products.

## Creating a Storyboard

Most importantly, it’s not necessary to know how to draw well to create a storyboard. Storyboards can be hand-drawn or created digitally. 

Several applications can help us develop storyboards without hand-drawing if you prefer. The structure of the story is the most essential aspect of storyboard creation.

The first thing we must consider is the structure of the story. Several aspects are essential to consider before setting out on our journey of storyboard creation. Our 3 primary considerations should be…

<br>

1. Character  
2. Scene  
3. Plot  

<br>

Let’s discuss each of these 3 considerations in a little more depth.

#### Character 

We’ve all created personas at this point. The character in your story will be your persona. At this point, you likely already have the bulk of your persona fleshed out. 

For example, what your persona looks like, their behaviors, expectations, and decisions that they may make. If you don’t have this content created yet, now is the time to do it. 

It’s vital that you understand how your character will be thinking, acting, and behaving throughout your storyboard creation process.

<br>

#### Scene

The scene is significantly more straightforward. Where will your persona be throughout this story? This should be a real place that your persona will actually encounter. 

Remember, we want to make our storyboards as realistic as possible.

<br>

#### Plot

Finally is the plot. This is likely the first thing you started considering while thinking about your storyboard. 

Remember that all good stories have a structure. You want a definite beginning, middle, and end. This is the narrative that you’ll be telling. 

The beginning of the plot will start with a trigger and end with a solution or a problem that your character needs to solve.

<br>

There are often important points that are overlooked when creating a storyboard. Remember, our goal is to capture the hearts and minds of our audience in a way that aligns with the problem we’re trying to solve. In that vein, remember to think about the following points…

<br>

1. Authenticity  
2. Simplicity  
3. Emotion  

<br>

We want the story to be authentic. By authentic, we want the story to be transparent, honest, and resonate with what we’re creating. An unauthentic story is easy to spot. Remember to keep it real.

We also want our story to be simple. It’s easy to see the value in simple stories. Only include elements that directly build on the story.

Finally, we want our story to contain emotion. This will drive home the value of our product and the state that our user is in. How does our character feel throughout the process? Remember to illustrate this in your story clearly.
