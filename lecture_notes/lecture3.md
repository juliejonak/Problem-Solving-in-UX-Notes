# Paper Prototyping

As UX designers, paper prototyping helps us generate and test ideas quickly. We use paper prototypes instead of their digital counterparts because of how rapidly we can create designs. The paper format also forces us to be more creative keeping our work in a throw-away format. That is to say, by not getting into our digital tools, we’re automatically more willing to take chances.

At the end of this module, you should be able to articulate the value of paper prototypes and create a paper prototype from sketches.

## Assignment

- [ ] Pick an action that a user might complete in Newsie that includes at least 5 different screens. Using pen and paper or InVision Freehand, sketch all 5 (or more) separate screens, and any supplementary screens (forms being filled in, etc.).

- [ ] Write 8-12 questions that you’d like to ask a user to validate the usability of your screens.

- [ ] Use images and InVision to create a prototype from your screens.

- [ ] Share your prototype and a description of the depicted task in Slack.

- [ ] Review and give feedback on at least 3 other prototypes.

#### Stretch Goals

Your company’s CEO wants to see how the project is coming along. They have a sales background, so they’re not familiar with UX or the Product Design Cycle. Explain to them the progress you’ve made so far, how paper prototyping fits into the Product Design Cycle, and the insights you’ve gained from paper prototyping.

#### Submission
- [ ] Submit an image of your sketches.
- [ ] Submit a link or PDF of your questions.
- [ ] Submit a link to your prototype.
- [ ] Submit a link or PDF to the feedback that you gave to other students.

## What is Paper Prototyping

At the most basic level, paper prototypes are simple sketches, using pen and paper. But, paper prototypes are not necessarily tied to pen and paper. They include sketches done with digital sketching tools, like drawing apps on a tablet.

Think of paper prototyping as the quick and cheap way of getting an idea -- the material quality isn't meant to be high and the speed should be a priority. It's meant for us to be able to demonstrate an idea, out of our minds, in a simple and quick way.

Paper prototyping is immensely popular, and because of this popularity, several tools have been developed to aid in the creation of these prototypes. These tools include a special paper with outlines of devices, stencils, and even tools to turn a paper prototype into a digital prototype with interactions.

Paper prototyping, while similar to digital prototyping with tools like Sketch and Figma, has some advantages over those digital counterparts.

## Paper prototyping advantages

#### Paper prototyping is fast.

Digital prototypes tend to take a long time to make because designers begin to get into details. While details are important, paper prototyping allows us to quickly test bigger ideas, flows, or concepts. They can be drawn, iterated upon, and entirely created in just a few minutes or hours.

#### Inexpensive.

All you need to create a paper prototype is a few sheets of paper and a pen!

#### Creativity

While software can be constrained by features, paper prototyping can happen at the speed of thought.

#### Team-building

Paper prototyping doesn’t have to be a solo endeavor, and it doesn’t have to include only paper! You can add a dash of creativity and fun to your paper prototyping session by involving other members of your organization (and other tools). Experiment with different types of papers, markers, colored pencils, and glue to create a unique prototype.

#### Documentation

Digital prototypes require documentation. Paper prototypes can be directly written on and saved for later. Notes can be captured in real-time. Paper prototypes can also be placed in a public location as a reminder of the work that’s been done.

## Paper Prototyping Disadvantages

#### Inaccurate feedback

Interacting with paper prototypes requires the user to use their imagination. They are best for testing big ideas, so paper prototypes are by necessity not detailed. This is inherently different than interacting with a digital product, or even a digital prototype. The conclusions drawn from interacting with a paper prototype may not translate to a digital product.

#### Extra work
As imaginative and fun as paper prototyping can be, it’s not as streamlined as digital products. Several digital products have been created to help designers create ‘sketch-like’ experiences in very little time. Paper prototypes often need to be translated to digital regardless.
While perceived as extra work, sometimes that extra work up front testing big ideas saves a lot of time and wasted effort down the road.

## When to Use Paper Prototyping

The best time for paper prototyping remains at the beginning of the product design process after user needs are understood. Early-stage ideation and conceptualization can be fulfilled through the creation of paper prototypes. Often, designers will find themselves creating sketches of interfaces on public whiteboards or similar. With paper prototyping, creating something the user can interact with is as simple as replicating those sketches on paper.

Paper prototypes can also be created directly in a brainstorming session. Creating a paper prototype while interacting with other stakeholders is the perfect opportunity for near-instantaneous feedback. Once the paper prototype has been refined in a brainstorming session, you’ll be ready to test it with actual users.

It’s important to remember that paper prototyping is best conducted early in the design process for optimal effectiveness.

## How to Create a Paper Prototype

Now that we understand what paper prototypes are best suited for, how do we actually create them? Here are a few tips to help you get started.

1. Use cheap paper

Printer paper or similar works best for this exercise. Remember, you want to enhance creativity, not restrict it.

2. Mobile-first

Starting with mobile will force you to focus on the _most essential_ content. If you’re able to create a mobile experience, it’ll be much easier to scale it up to larger screen sizes later.

3. One sketch per screen

Paper prototyping and physical sketches are meant to be simple to view and understand. Remember to keep each screen (and interaction) as it’s own sketch. The sketches you create will likely become a prototype. You’ll want to ensure your users can focus on one screen at a time throughout their experience, and make it simple for you to have one interaction per screen, to avoid the need to explain.

## Paper Prototype Testing

Now that we have our paper prototype, it’s time to test it with users. The question is, how do we test sketches with users? It’s actually quite simple.

#### Be the ‘computer’

To facilitate interactions within the prototype, one person will need to be the ‘computer.’ This means silently showing the screens to the participant, and moving through the screens as a user ‘clicks’ or ‘interacts’ on the prototype. If at all possible, the person acting as the ‘computer’ should not also be facilitating the session. Designating one person as the ‘computer’ will better simulate an automated system.

This process walks through the user's anticipated experience without including the designer's bias. Even if this process shows a gap in the design, move through what was previously designed. It shows areas for improvement and where user confusion might arise.


#### Practice

Playing the role of ‘computer’ and shuffling through screens is a difficult task. Almost as tricky as facilitating the session itself. Remember to practice your part before conducting a test.


#### Follow best practices

Try to test at least 5 users with your prototype and record the tests if possible. Remember to explain to your users what they’re interacting with and what to expect throughout the session ahead of time. Interacting with a paper prototype will likely be entirely foreign to your users, so be sure to explain why and how to interact with it.

We’ll talk more about usability studies later in the course. There are often more formalities in that process. Paper prototyping can be pretty scrappy by comparison. It’s just meant as a way for you as a designer to get some feedback on your ideas.
