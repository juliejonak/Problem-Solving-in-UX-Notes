# Paper Prototyping

As UX designers, paper prototyping helps us generate and test ideas quickly. We use paper prototypes instead of their digital counterparts because of how rapidly we can create designs. The paper format also forces us to be more creative keeping our work in a throw-away format. That is to say, by not getting into our digital tools, we’re automatically more willing to take chances.

At the end of this module, you should be able to articulate the value of paper prototypes and create a paper prototype from sketches.

## What is Paper Prototyping

At the most basic level, paper prototypes are simple sketches, using pen and paper. But, paper prototypes are not necessarily tied to pen and paper. They include sketches done with digital sketching tools, like drawing apps on a tablet.

Think of paper prototyping as the quick and cheap way of getting an idea -- the material quality isn't meant to be high and the speed should be a priority. It's meant for us to be able to demonstrate an idea, out of our minds, in a simple and quick way.

Paper prototyping is immensely popular, and because of this popularity, several tools have been developed to aid in the creation of these prototypes. These tools include a special paper with outlines of devices, stencils, and even tools to turn a paper prototype into a digital prototype with interactions.

Paper prototyping, while similar to digital prototyping with tools like Sketch and Figma, has some advantages over those digital counterparts.

## Paper prototyping advantages

#### Paper prototyping is fast.

Digital prototypes tend to take a long time to make because designers begin to get into details. While details are important, paper prototyping allows us to quickly test bigger ideas, flows, or concepts. They can be drawn, iterated upon, and entirely created in just a few minutes or hours.

#### Inexpensive.

All you need to create a paper prototype is a few sheets of paper and a pen!

#### Creativity

While software can be constrained by features, paper prototyping can happen at the speed of thought.

#### Team-building

Paper prototyping doesn’t have to be a solo endeavor, and it doesn’t have to include only paper! You can add a dash of creativity and fun to your paper prototyping session by involving other members of your organization (and other tools). Experiment with different types of papers, markers, colored pencils, and glue to create a unique prototype.

#### Documentation

Digital prototypes require documentation. Paper prototypes can be directly written on and saved for later. Notes can be captured in real-time. Paper prototypes can also be placed in a public location as a reminder of the work that’s been done.

## Paper Prototyping Disadvantages

#### Inaccurate feedback

Interacting with paper prototypes requires the user to use their imagination. They are best for testing big ideas, so paper prototypes are by necessity not detailed. This is inherently different than interacting with a digital product, or even a digital prototype. The conclusions drawn from interacting with a paper prototype may not translate to a digital product.

#### Extra work
As imaginative and fun as paper prototyping can be, it’s not as streamlined as digital products. Several digital products have been created to help designers create ‘sketch-like’ experiences in very little time. Paper prototypes often need to be translated to digital regardless.
While perceived as extra work, sometimes that extra work up front testing big ideas saves a lot of time and wasted effort down the road.
