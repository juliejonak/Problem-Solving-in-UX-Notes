### Assignment

#### Instructions

- [ ] Create a card sort study in OptimalWorkshop for Newsie with at least 20 cards.

- [ ] Get at least 5 participants to complete your card sort. They can be family, friends, or peers. In a professional setting, you will often have to source your own users on short notice. So, it is an important skill to practice.

- [ ] Create a sitemap for your chosen project based on the data you received through your card-sort.

- [ ] Summarize your card sort discoveries for your Product Manager. They want to understand what insights you uncovered through this exercise and how they’ll impact the product’s development. Don’t just say, “I did a card sort. I found this.” Be sure to explain why your insights matter.

#### Submission

 - [ ] Submit a link to your card sort.
 - [ ] Submit a link to the results page of your card sort.
 - [ ] Submit a PNG of your completed sitemap.
 - [ ] Submit a link or PDF of your summary.
