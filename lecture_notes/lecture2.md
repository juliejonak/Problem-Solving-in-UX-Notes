## Assignment

#### Instructions

- [ ] Create a card sort study in OptimalWorkshop for Newsie with at least 20 cards.

- [ ] Get at least 5 participants to complete your card sort. They can be family, friends, or peers. In a professional setting, you will often have to source your own users on short notice. So, it is an important skill to practice.

- [ ] Create a sitemap for your chosen project based on the data you received through your card-sort.

- [ ] Summarize your card sort discoveries for your Product Manager. They want to understand what insights you uncovered through this exercise and how they’ll impact the product’s development. Don’t just say, “I did a card sort. I found this.” Be sure to explain why your insights matter.

#### Submission

 - [ ] Submit a link to your card sort.
 - [ ] Submit a link to the results page of your card sort.
 - [ ] Submit a PNG of your completed sitemap.
 - [ ] Submit a link or PDF of your summary.

## What is Information Architecture

Information architecture (IA) helps your users understand their surroundings and find what they’re looking for in our products. IA is often one of the first parts of our product that we design. In doing so, we focus:

> “on organizing, structuring, and labeling content in an effective and sustainable way [in order to] help users find information and complete tasks.”  
> - Usability.gov


There are opportunities and real costs associated with your IA. As explained in _Information Architecture: For the Web and Beyond_ by Peter Morville, these costs include:

- Finding information (What is the cost of frustrating your customers with a poorly organized web site?)  

- Not finding information (How many customers do you lose because they can’t find the product they want on your web site?)  

- The value of education (What is the value of educating your customers about new products and services related to the ones they’re actively   
seeking on your web site?)

- Construction (What does it cost to design and build a web site? How much does it cost to redo it six months later because it doesn’t support   
find-ability or doesn’t scale?)

- Maintenance (Similarly, what does it cost to insure that good designs don’t crumble over time? Will the people who maintain your site know   
where to put new content and when to remove outdated content?)

- Training (For internal, mission-critical information systems that support call centers, for example, what does it cost to train employees to   
use that system? How much could you save if it wasn’t so complicated to use?)  

- The value of the brand (No matter how beautiful your web site is if customers can’t find what they need, your brand loses value in their eyes.   

- How much did you spend on those brand-building TV commercials?)

<br>

## Organizing Content

Designing a coherent, intuitive IA is a challenging process. Before we begin, we need to understand our users’ information-seeking needs and behaviors. 

Let’s start with their information needs first. To understand them, we need to ask ourselves: when a user comes to a website to find something, what does she really want? What are her information needs?

We can break these down into four distinct seeking rationales.

- Known-item seeking is when the user has a question that can be immediately answered when found.  

- Exploratory seeking is when users don’t really know what they’re looking for, so they hope whatever ambles into their search will be good enough.  

- Exhaustive research is when users will leave no stone unturned to learn new information about a topic.  

- Read later is when users have seen content before, and they’re looking for it again.  

<br>

Once we understand why they’re looking for information, we can ask ourselves: how do website users find information, or what are their information-seeking behaviors? 

They might enter queries in search systems, browse from link to link, and ask humans for help (through email, chat interfaces, and so forth). 

Searching, browsing, and asking are all methods for finding, and are the basic building blocks of information-seeking behavior.

To understand and build our IAs, we rely on card-sorting to keep track of discrete units of our product in order to test different organizational models. 

Once we understand how users interpret our terminology and groupings, we progress to site mapping and content audits to logically present our product’s IA. Along the way, we can continue to ensure our IAs are usable by conducting evaluations of their efficacy.

Building an IA from scratch or improving an existing one is an enormous undertaking. Not only does it require substantial efforts, but the stakes are also high because it’ll serve as the basis for the rest of your user experience. That said, with a strong understanding of the fundamentals, we can iterate through even the most convoluted systems and design an intuitive information architecture.

## How to Create a Sitemap

While a true information architect would have many deliverables that they can produce, as user experience designers we typically focus on sitemaps.

Sitemaps are essentially diagrams of our content and are a tangible representation of our information architecture. They’re similar to our user flows, but they take into account context, content, as well as our users.

To create a sitemap, we’ll follow this process:

### Understand the context

By this point, it should come as no surprise that we start by reviewing any UX work done up to this point. In particular, we’re interested in reviewing any user research, business objectives, user flows, and existing content. As we review this information, we’re trying to understand what the content needs are going to be for the organization, how they currently organize their content, and how our users expect the content to be organized.

<br>

### Organize the content with card-sorting

Once you’ve reviewed everything and determined the current content ecosystem, you’re ready to begin developing a new IA for the product. To do that, you’ll want to try and categorize all of the existing content and planned content into broad groups. For example, if your company has a bunch of lightbulb products try grouping them into categories based on their size, lumens, wattage, or other criteria.

After you have some groupings, you can perform a card-sorting exercise. Card-sorting is an exercise that helps us understand how to organize offerings so users know what you have and how to find it. In practice, this means getting a bunch of index cards or post-it notes and writing out all of the features or pages of your website and then having users group the cards as they see fit. This technique helps us understand our users’ point-of-view and how they would expect our website to be organized.

To perform a card-sorting exercise, write your groupings on a bunch of index cards. Then, invite users and stakeholders to organize the cards as they see fit. After several iterations, patterns should begin to emerge. These patterns can now inform your site blueprint.

It’s important to remember that card sorting is a tool to inform our efforts, so our site blueprint doesn’t need to be an exact match of our card sorting results. Instead, since we have the full picture of the project, we should be comfortable overruling these results when it makes sense.

<br>

### Create a sitemap

While our card sorting helped us organize our content into distinct groups, our sitemap lets us connect the dots and describe the relationships between our features.

There’s no one way to organize your sitemap, but this approach works well for any size project. To start, create an Excel document. Then, using your findings from the card-sorting exercise, create a row for each page your product will need. For each page, make sure to add details about the content that will live there, where it sits in the site’s hierarchy, unique features/design considerations, and any additional details that are relevant to you.

<br>

### User test your sitemap

Finally, you’re ready to test your sitemap. To test it, write each page on an index card. Then on the bottom of each card, write out the links that exist on that page. 

Next, come up with some user tasks that you’d like users to accomplish on the site. Finally, you can have users start at the first page in your hierarchy and you can test how they’d navigate to different pages to complete the task. This is a great way to see if your page labeling makes sense and if users can find the content they want.
