# Paper Prototyping

As UX designers, paper prototyping helps us generate and test ideas quickly. We use paper prototypes instead of their digital counterparts because of how rapidly we can create designs. The paper format also forces us to be more creative keeping our work in a throw-away format. That is to say, by not getting into our digital tools, weâ€™re automatically more willing to take chances.

At the end of this module, you should be able to articulate the value of paper prototypes and create a paper prototype from sketches.
