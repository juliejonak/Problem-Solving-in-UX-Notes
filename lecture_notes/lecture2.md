### Assignment

#### Instructions

- [ ] Create a card sort study in OptimalWorkshop for Newsie with at least 20 cards.

- [ ] Get at least 5 participants to complete your card sort. They can be family, friends, or peers. In a professional setting, you will often have to source your own users on short notice. So, it is an important skill to practice.

- [ ] Create a sitemap for your chosen project based on the data you received through your card-sort.

- [ ] Summarize your card sort discoveries for your Product Manager. They want to understand what insights you uncovered through this exercise and how they’ll impact the product’s development. Don’t just say, “I did a card sort. I found this.” Be sure to explain why your insights matter.

#### Submission

 - [ ] Submit a link to your card sort.
 - [ ] Submit a link to the results page of your card sort.
 - [ ] Submit a PNG of your completed sitemap.
 - [ ] Submit a link or PDF of your summary.

## What is Information Architecture

Information architecture (IA) helps your users understand their surroundings and find what they’re looking for in our products. IA is often one of the first parts of our product that we design. In doing so, we focus:

> “on organizing, structuring, and labeling content in an effective and sustainable way [in order to] help users find information and complete tasks.”  
> - Usability.gov


There are opportunities and real costs associated with your IA. As explained in _Information Architecture: For the Web and Beyond_ by Peter Morville, these costs include:

- Finding information (What is the cost of frustrating your customers with a poorly organized web site?)  

- Not finding information (How many customers do you lose because they can’t find the product they want on your web site?)  

- The value of education (What is the value of educating your customers about new products and services related to the ones they’re actively   
seeking on your web site?)

- Construction (What does it cost to design and build a web site? How much does it cost to redo it six months later because it doesn’t support   
find-ability or doesn’t scale?)

- Maintenance (Similarly, what does it cost to insure that good designs don’t crumble over time? Will the people who maintain your site know   
where to put new content and when to remove outdated content?)

- Training (For internal, mission-critical information systems that support call centers, for example, what does it cost to train employees to   
use that system? How much could you save if it wasn’t so complicated to use?)  

- The value of the brand (No matter how beautiful your web site is if customers can’t find what they need, your brand loses value in their eyes.   

- How much did you spend on those brand-building TV commercials?)

## Organizing content

Designing a coherent, intuitive IA is a challenging process. Before we begin, we need to understand our users’ information-seeking needs and behaviors. 

Let’s start with their information needs first. To understand them, we need to ask ourselves: when a user comes to a website to find something, what does she really want? What are her information needs?

We can break these down into four distinct seeking rationales.

- Known-item seeking is when the user has a question that can be immediately answered when found.  

- Exploratory seeking is when users don’t really know what they’re looking for, so they hope whatever ambles into their search will be good enough.  

- Exhaustive research is when users will leave no stone unturned to learn new information about a topic.  

- Read later is when users have seen content before, and they’re looking for it again.

Once we understand why they’re looking for information, we can ask ourselves: how do website users find information, or what are their information-seeking behaviors? 

They might enter queries in search systems, browse from link to link, and ask humans for help (through email, chat interfaces, and so forth). 

Searching, browsing, and asking are all methods for finding, and are the basic building blocks of information-seeking behavior.

To understand and build our IAs, we rely on card-sorting to keep track of discrete units of our product in order to test different organizational models. 

Once we understand how users interpret our terminology and groupings, we progress to site mapping and content audits to logically present our product’s IA. Along the way, we can continue to ensure our IAs are usable by conducting evaluations of their efficacy.

Building an IA from scratch or improving an existing one is an enormous undertaking. Not only does it require substantial efforts, but the stakes are also high because it’ll serve as the basis for the rest of your user experience. That said, with a strong understanding of the fundamentals, we can iterate through even the most convoluted systems and design an intuitive information architecture.
