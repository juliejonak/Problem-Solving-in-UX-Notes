# Guerilla Usability Testing

Guerilla Usability is a quick method of getting feedback from users. It gives us a taste of user research that we will cover in more depth later.

At the end of this module, you should be able to articulate the value of user testing and test a paper prototype.

## Assignment


#### Instructions

- [ ] Create a guerrilla usability test plan for Newsie.

- [ ] Sketch the task(s) need to conduct your study.

- [ ] Use InVision to stitch together images of your sketched prototype (if testing online) or use your sketches to conduct an in-person usability test.

- [ ] Test your prototype with at least 3 other people. You can conduct this test in person or online. You may use friends, family, and other students.

- [ ] Your team is ready to hear the results of your tests. Prepare a short summary of your methodology and your findings.

#### Stretch Goal

After completing your guerrilla usability test, update your sketches to incorporate your test discoveries and improve the usability.

#### Submission

- [ ] Submit a link or PDF of your usability test plan.
- [ ] Submit a PNG or JPG of your sketches.

## The Value of User Testing

As UX designers, we want to ensure that our users are happy and able to achieve their goals with our products. In other words, we want a high level of user satisfaction. 

To ensure that our users are meeting their goals, we turn to usability testing. 

Usability testing helps us understand both the successes and failures the user encounter while using our product. 

User testing allows us to both create a product that our users really want, and stay ahead of our competition.

A product that helps users achieve their goals keep users coming back for more. It’s a win-win situation.

<br>

For user testing to work within an organization, it needs to be a priority. 

Stakeholders, project owners, and executives all need to be on board with the process. 

If user testing is to succeed, it must not be an option. 

If you, or somebody else, is already utilizing user testing, then you likely have a good set of evidence in order to keep the process going. If not, then it’s up to you as the UX designer to prove that value of usability testing. 

Through the creation and testing of designs and prototypes, you’ll gain the experience and foundation you need to show decision-makers the positive impact that user testing can have.

<br>

When integrating user testing, it’s helpful to think of it as an objective, rather than a procedure. 

If we focus on that perfect procedure for running usability tests, we’ll encounter more issues than needed. 

Remember, perfect can be the enemy of great. You do not need the most polished prototype or design to run a user test.
