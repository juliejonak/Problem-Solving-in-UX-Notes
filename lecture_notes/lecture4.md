# Guerilla Usability Testing

Guerilla Usability is a quick method of getting feedback from users. It gives us a taste of user research that we will cover in more depth later.

At the end of this module, you should be able to articulate the value of user testing and test a paper prototype.

## Assignment


#### Instructions

- [ ] Create a guerrilla usability test plan for Newsie.

- [ ] Sketch the task(s) need to conduct your study.

- [ ] Use InVision to stitch together images of your sketched prototype (if testing online) or use your sketches to conduct an in-person usability test.

- [ ] Test your prototype with at least 3 other people. You can conduct this test in person or online. You may use friends, family, and other students.

- [ ] Your team is ready to hear the results of your tests. Prepare a short summary of your methodology and your findings.

#### Stretch Goal

After completing your guerrilla usability test, update your sketches to incorporate your test discoveries and improve the usability.

#### Submission

- [ ] Submit a link or PDF of your usability test plan.
- [ ] Submit a PNG or JPG of your sketches.
- [ ] Submit a link to your prototype in InVision.
- [ ] Submit a link or PDF of your task completion chart.
- [ ] Submit a link or PDF of your summary.

## The Value of User Testing

As UX designers, we want to ensure that our users are happy and able to achieve their goals with our products. In other words, we want a high level of user satisfaction. 

To ensure that our users are meeting their goals, we turn to usability testing. 

Usability testing helps us understand both the successes and failures the user encounter while using our product. 

User testing allows us to both create a product that our users really want, and stay ahead of our competition.

A product that helps users achieve their goals keep users coming back for more. It’s a win-win situation.

<br>

For user testing to work within an organization, it needs to be a priority. 

Stakeholders, project owners, and executives all need to be on board with the process. 

If user testing is to succeed, it must not be an option. 

If you, or somebody else, is already utilizing user testing, then you likely have a good set of evidence in order to keep the process going. If not, then it’s up to you as the UX designer to prove that value of usability testing. 

Through the creation and testing of designs and prototypes, you’ll gain the experience and foundation you need to show decision-makers the positive impact that user testing can have.

<br>

When integrating user testing, it’s helpful to think of it as an objective, rather than a procedure. 

If we focus on that perfect procedure for running usability tests, we’ll encounter more issues than needed. 

Remember, perfect can be the enemy of great. You do not need the most polished prototype or design to run a user test.

## What is Guerilla Usability Testing

According to UsabilityGeek:

> “guerrilla usability testing is a way to evaluate how effective an interface is by testing out its visual design, functionality and general message on its intended audience and capturing their responses.” 

This method of user testing is one of the most straightforward and inexpensive methods to use when embarking on a user research project. 

Guerrilla usability testing needs little more than a paper prototype and can be conducted nearly anywhere. This includes testing with coworkers, friends, and family members!

<br>

It’s best to perform guerrilla usability testing when you need quick and cheap testing. 

This type of usability testing also lends itself well to ad-hoc recruitment. In other words, finding the best participants you can in the immediate vicinity. 

Of course, when using ad-hoc participants, your results will be less accurate than if you were to use your target user base. 

Guerrilla studies are very short, often between 10-15 minutes, and can have as few as 5 participants for meaningful feedback. 

The fact that guerrilla usability testing is inexpensive, easy, and fast makes it one of the best ways to introduce user research at an organization with little to no experience with user testing.

<br>

To conduct a guerrilla usability test, you only need a prototype, a computer, a moderator (somebody to run the test), and somebody to observe and take notes. 

If you’re not able to get a moderator and/or somebody to take notes, you could also record participants’ responses using a screen recorder. 

Keep in mind though, observing a users behavior and body language is always the preferable way of conducting usability tests.

## What to Test

Before conducting your test, it’s important that you decide _what_ you want to learn. 

Although guerrilla usability testing is cheap and efficient, you still need to do a significant amount of planning beforehand. 

First, you’ll want to understand what you want the user to do. For example, maybe you want them to sign up for an account or learn about your product. Most importantly, you’ll want to define your goal and write it down ahead of time.

After you’ve decided on a goal, you’ll need to come up with tasks for your users to complete.

<br>

Here’s an example from UsabilityGeek:

> “If you want to optimize your checkout experience, your task list might look something like this:

Add an item to the cart Browse additional items Go to the checkout page Sign in Change the delivery address Confirm the transaction details Print the payment confirmation Locate the payment authorization in the email inbox”

Your goal is to keep your test as focused as possible. Avoid testing extraneous features or functionality.

## How to Test

You may choose to start your guerrilla usability study by walking up to a friend, coworker, or person at a coffee shop and asking them if they’d like to participate. You’ll want to explain what the test is, how it works, and how long you expect it to take.

Because your goal is to understand user behavior, you’ll want to ask your participant to think out loud. If they are not thinking out loud throughout the study, you may need to prompt them to do so.

Once you’ve explained the test, it’s time to get started. If you’re using a paper prototype, you’ll want to take a few minutes and make sure it’s prepared ahead of time. 

Conversely, if you’re using a digital prototype, setup will be as easy as pulling out the device you’d like the user to test on.

As a test facilitator, you’ll want to keep your own thoughts to a minimum. 

Remember, this test is about understanding how a user interacts with your product. You aren’t selling the product or it’s features to your user. Once the test is complete, you may answer any questions that the user has.
